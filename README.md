### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a QA Automation engineer, with **<span id="experience"></span> years of experience**.

<script>
  const startDate = new Date('2008-01-01');
  const currentDate = new Date();
  const diffTime = Math.abs(currentDate - startDate);
  const diffYears = Math.floor(diffTime / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 365));
  document.getElementById('experience').innerHTML = diffYears;
</script>
